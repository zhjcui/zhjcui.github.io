  		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  		<p>Zhonghao Cui is currently a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin. He plans on graduating in 2016 and will be pursuing a medical degree at the UT Southwestern Medical Center. </p>

      <p>Despite being born in the People's Republic of China, Zhonghao does not remember much of his early childhood there. All he remembers is that he was bald like Caillou and the pizza there had really bad cheese. When he was a month away from five years old, he and his mother flew to the United States of America to join his father, who had been working on his PhD in Physics in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In Milwaukee, Zhonghao attended many different elementary schools, and eventually left in 2003 to move 100 miles away to Chicago.</p>

      <p>In Chicago, Zhonghao first attended Willard Elementary school, which his parents didn't think very highly of. He pretended to be an ESL student in order to be moved into Orrington Elementary, the only elementary school in the region to have a fully-fledged ESL program. He suffered there for two years, all the while pretending that he was bad at English.</p>

      <p>Salvation came, however, in the form of middle school. Zhonghao had a boring two years of middle school in Chicago, then he moved hella far away to Greensboro, North Carolina. He would stay there for the majority of his high school career and would nominally live there for the first year of his college career. Since graduating from the Early College at Guilford in 2012, Zhonghao has moved to Texas and is now attending UT Austin.
